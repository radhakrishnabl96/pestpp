\ The variables that need to change are indicated by (C). The test of the variables do not need to change (Probably when the program does not run, we need to rethink).

\ Termination variables
\ Imp - NOPTMAX, an integer variable, sets the maximum number of iterations that an inversion or optimization process is allowed to run.
\ NOPTMAX = 0, to check if the setup is done properly
0 0 0 \ ICOV ICOR IEIG
\PESTPP-GLM does not use any of these variables and it is recommended to set these valeus to 0
\ The Singular Value Decomposition method section is considered in PESTPP to solve the ill-posed inverse problem for ensuring numerical stability

* parameter groups
ro relative 0.01 0.0 switch 2.0 parabolic \ PARGPNME INCTYP DERINC DERINCLB FORCEN DERINCMUL DERMTHD (C)
h relative 0.01 0.0 switch 2.0 parabolic \ PARGPNME INCTYP DERINC DERINCLB FORCEN DERINCMUL DERMTHD (C)
\ PARGPNME - Parameter group name, 
\ INCTYP - Increment type for forward difference calculation, if it is 'relative' - than DERINC is the fraction that the parameter is incremented by
\ About DERMTHD and switch - On most occasions, FORCEN should be set to “switch” while DERMTHD should be set to “parabolic”.
