================================================================================

  JobID     - ID number of the job/step.
               <JobID>.batch: resources requested/used by all commands (including mpirun!) in the job script EXCEPT srun
               <JobID>.extern: resources used by external commands (e.g. session opened by SSH on the reserved node)
               <JobID>.<number>: resources requested/used by the job step (COMMAND srun!) of <number> in the job script

  ReqNodes  - Requested number of nodes for the job/step
  ReqCPUS   - Requested number of CPUs for the job/step
  ReqMem    - Requested amount of memory per CPU ('c' at the end) or 
              per node ('n' at the end) for the job (NOT the step)
  Timelimit - Wallclock time requested for the job

  TotalCPU  - Total CPU time (SystemCPU + UserCPU) used by the job/step
  MaxRSS    - Maximum memory(resident set size) among all tasks in the job/step
  NNode     - Number of nodes in the job/step
  NTasks    - Number of tasks in the job/step
  Elapsed   - Wallclock time spent on the job/step
  ExitCode  - Exit code returned by the job/step
  NodeList  - List of nodes used in job/step
